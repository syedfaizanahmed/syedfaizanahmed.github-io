# Project: Identifiers for making better insurance strategies

In the world of insurance, one of the most important task is the development of different isurance packages and strategies catering to the background of the costumers. This task can prove to be highly fruitful if the new strategies and insurance packages are designed using informed data and trend changes from past to present.

To see the change in trends, it is essential to not only look at the current data trends but also, to look and compare it past data trends, which can be used to provide much better insight into the long running changes.

This project is aimed at developing and recognising patterns for the background common information of people from different regions in the US from year 1993 which could be used to amalgamate into the current data to identify changes which could be used to develop better insurance packages catering to the needs and affordability of future potential insurance buyers.


## Data Science tools at work

The image below shows the frequency of working wives with different levels of education in different regions of US.

It can be fairly deduced that the in all the regions, the most number of working wives, covered by husbands insurance, have 12 years of education.
This is a great indicator which can be further refined by taking in the working hours per week of working wives, if the working wives have kids from ages 1 to 6 or 6 to 18 and monthly income of husband.

## Deductions

Not much can deduced than what has already been stated. But the most promising aspect is the introduction of new variables, which will surely provide with much meaningful identifiers and many amazing strategic points can be made if these identifiers be compared side by side with current data of similar kind.
